moisture content is on a [0, ∞) scale, as it is the ratio of water mass to dry
mass. The values we are importing are percentages, thus the `k = 0.01` factor.
This is first transformed to water content as a percent of total weight
(on a [0, 1] scale), an then to a logistic (on a (-∞, ∞) scale) for modeling
purposes.

Missing gravimetric moisture content for observations of massive ice will be
imputed to the value specified by `ice_gmc`. The default is 2,000% gravimetric
moisture content, equivalent to approximately 95% water content.
